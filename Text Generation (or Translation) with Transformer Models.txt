Text Generation (or Translation) with Transformer Models

Objective:  Understand the core principles of the Transformer architecture, fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer model on a text-based task, and use it for predictions.

System Requirements

Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
Hardware:
CPU: Modern multi-core processor.
RAM: 16GB minimum, 32GB or more strongly recommended.
GPU: A powerful NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is essential for reasonable training times.
Software:
Python: (https://www.python.org/). Version 3.6 or later recommended.
TensorFlow or PyTorch (Choose one): Install with pip install tensorflow or pip install torch
Transformers Library (Hugging Face): Install with pip install transformers
Lab Procedure

Choice of Task: Focus is Key

Text Generation: Train a language model to generate creative text samples.
Machine Translation: Train a model to translate between languages (e.g., English-French).
I'll outline the lab for Text Generation. Machine Translation would follow a similar pattern with adjustments to the dataset and model configuration.

Transformer Fundamentals

Brief Review: Cover attention mechanisms, self-attention, encoder-decoder structures.

Dataset Preparation

Text Corpus: A sizable text dataset is needed (novels, articles, etc.).
Data Sources:
Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org/)
Hugging Face Datasets (https://huggingface.co/datasets)
Preprocessing and Tokenization

Transformers Tokenizer: Use a tokenizer from the transformers library aligned with your chosen pre-trained model.
Text Sequencing: Prepare input and target sequences for language modeling.
Loading a Pre-trained Transformer

Python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

model_name = "t5-small"  # Example model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
Use code with caution.
Fine-tuning

Python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          
    num_train_epochs=3,           
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,  
    # ... other arguments 
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,                         
    args=training_args,                 
    train_dataset=train_dataset,         
    eval_dataset=val_dataset        
)

trainer.train()
Use code with caution.
Text Generation

Python
input_text = "Today is a beautiful day"
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors='pt').input_ids

output_sequences = model.generate(input_ids) 

generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output_sequences[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(generated_text) 
Use code with caution.
Evaluation

Qualitative: Examine generated text for coherence and creativity.
Perplexity: (Optional) For a more quantitative measure.
