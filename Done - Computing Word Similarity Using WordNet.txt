Prerequisites

Python: You'll need Python installed (https://www.python.org/)
NLTK: Install the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library: pip install nltk
WordNet: NLTK needs WordNet. Download it by running nltk.download('wordnet') in your Python terminal.

Importing Libraries:

This block imports necessary libraries for the code to run, including nltk for Natural Language Processing tasks and wordnet from nltk.corpus for accessing WordNet.
Checking WordNet Download:

This block checks if WordNet is already downloaded by verifying the existence of synsets for the word "car". If WordNet is not downloaded, it downloads it using nltk.download('wordnet').
Defining the compute_similarity Function:

This block defines a function named compute_similarity that takes two words as input and computes their similarity using WordNet's Wu-Palmer similarity measure.
It retrieves synsets for both input words using wordnet.synsets(word).
It iterates through all possible pairs of synsets for the input words and computes the similarity between them using the Wu-Palmer similarity measure (synset1.wup_similarity(synset2)).
It updates the max_similarity variable to store the maximum similarity found among all pairs of synsets.
Finally, it returns the maximum similarity score.
Testing the Function:

This block tests the compute_similarity function by providing two example words, "car" and "automobile", and prints the similarity score computed by the function.
Printing Output:

This block prints a message indicating that the output was printed successfully, serving as a confirmation of the completion of the code execution.

import nltk
from nltk.corpus import wordnet

# Check if WordNet is already downloaded, if not, download it
if not nltk.corpus.wordnet.synsets('car'):
    nltk.download('wordnet')

def compute_similarity(word1, word2):
    # Get synsets for both words
    synsets1 = wordnet.synsets(word1)
    synsets2 = wordnet.synsets(word2)
    
    max_similarity = 0
    
    # Iterate through all pairs of synsets and compute similarity
    for synset1 in synsets1:
        for synset2 in synsets2:
            # Compute similarity using Wu-Palmer similarity measure
            similarity = synset1.wup_similarity(synset2)
            # Update maximum similarity if the current similarity is greater
            if similarity is not None and similarity > max_similarity:
                max_similarity = similarity
    
    return max_similarity

# Test the function
word1 = "car"
word2 = "automobile"
similarity = compute_similarity(word1, word2)
print(f"Similarity between '{word1}' and '{word2}': {similarity}")

# Print a message indicating successful completion of code execution
print("Output printed successfully.")
