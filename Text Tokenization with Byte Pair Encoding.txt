Text Tokenization with Byte Pair Encoding

Objective:  Understand the BPE algorithm, train a BPE tokenizer on a text corpus, and apply it for text tokenization tasks.

System Requirements

Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
Hardware:
CPU: Modern dual-core processor or better.
RAM: 4GB minimum, 8GB or more recommended.
Software:
Python: (https://www.python.org/). Version 3.6 or later recommended.
subword-nmt: Install with pip install subword-nmt
Optional: SentencePiece: Install with pip install sentencepiece. SentencePiece offers an alternative, highly efficient BPE implementation.
Lab Procedure

Understanding Byte Pair Encoding

Explanation:
Starts with character-level vocabulary.
Iteratively merges frequent character pairs into new symbols.
Balances vocabulary size and handling of rare words.
Advantages:
Open vocabulary
Works well for morphologically rich languages
Preparing a Text Corpus

Dataset: A plain text corpus (articles, code, etc.). The quality and size of your corpus influence the quality of the tokenizer.
Preprocessing (Optional): Consider light normalization (lowercasing, handling special characters) if it aligns with your task.
Training a BPE Tokenizer (using subword-nmt)

Bash
subword-nmt learn-bpe -s 30000 < corpus.txt > codes.txt  # Train with vocab size of 30000
Use code with caution.
Parameters: -s controls the desired vocabulary size. Experiment with different values.
Applying the BPE Tokenizer

Bash
subword-nmt apply-bpe -c codes.txt < input.txt > output.txt
Use code with caution.
Python
import subword_nmt as subword

tokenizer = subword.load_bpe('codes.txt')

sentence = "This is a sentence for tokenization."
tokens = tokenizer.segment(sentence)
print(tokens)
Use code with caution.
Decoding BPE Tokens

Python
# Reverse the encoding process
decoded_text = tokens.replace('@@ ', '')  
print(decoded_text)
Use code with caution.
Tasks

Vocabulary Size: Train with different vocabulary sizes and observe the impact on tokenization.
Different Corpora: Explore how the corpus type influences the learned vocabulary.
SentencePiece: Train a BPE tokenizer using SentencePiece and compare the results and speed.
Evaluation

Qualitative: Examine tokenized outputs from different models, especially how they handle unknown words.
Performance: If speed is critical, benchmark SentencePiece vs. subword-nmt.
Additional Considerations

Word Boundary Symbol: Some implementations add a special end-of-word symbol like '@@'.
Advanced Usage: BPE is often integrated into large pre-trained language models (e.g., GPT-2, BERT).


import subword_nmt as subword

# Assuming you've trained your BPE model and have a 'codes.txt' file:
tokenizer = subword.load_bpe('codes.txt') 

sentence = "This is a sentence for tokenization."
tokens = tokenizer.segment(sentence)
print(tokens) 

decoded_text = ' '.join(tokens).replace('@@ ', '')  
print(decoded_text)
